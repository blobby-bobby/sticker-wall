# 👽 WELCOME TO THE STICKER WALL 👽 

The sticker wall is pretty simple : click on the wall 🖱️, it will put a sticker on it 👾.

## Concept

- This actual version is just about it for now, a random sticker on that wall. 
- But hopefully, pretty soon, you will have choice on wich sticker you want to add on that wall.
- If new ideas of other functionalities comes up, i may be working on it to improve the wall.

## About the stickers

- I use a sample of 8 stickers that I made for this first version.
- I would like to grow this collection, try other styles, to allow other functionalities, and just to make this wall funnier.

## 🛠 Stack

This project has been the perfect exercise to strenghten my skills on :

- React
- TypeScript
- Framer Motion
- SASS

## Enjoy, come & put a sticker the wall
