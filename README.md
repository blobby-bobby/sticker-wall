![Capture](./src/assets/sticker-wall-capture.jpg)

The sticker wall is pretty simple : click on the wall 🖱️, it will put a sticker on it 👾.

## Concept

- This actual version is just about it for now, a random sticker on that wall. 
- But hopefully, pretty soon, you will have choice on wich sticker you want to add on that wall.
- If new ideas of other functionalities comes up, i may be working on it to improve the wall.

## Recent updates

- The deck of stickers has been doubled : enjoy your 8 new sticker.
- You can take screenshots of your wall, and make a wallpaper of it for your device
- You can reset the wall, meaning remove all stickers at once if you want to
- UI improvements and quirkier style there and there
